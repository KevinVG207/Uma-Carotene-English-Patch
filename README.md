## Overview

Carotene is an English patch project for the Uma Musume: Pretty Derby (DMM Version) game. This project is based around these main goals:

- Speed and ease of use. (One-click patch/unpatch)
- Public, community-driven and *free* forever!
- As little jank in the game UI as possible.
- No copyrighted material in the public patch.
- No machine translation.

## Features

- **Sprite Replacement**: Carotene can replace textures/sprites in the game for text that is stored as images. Examples are the buttons during training and comics.
- **Translated Skill Names and Descriptions**: Skill names, descriptions, and missions are translated.
- **Simple User Interface**: Carotene Patcher provides a simple one-click patch/unpatch interface. It also has a built-in updater, so you will always have the latest version of the patch.
- **Custom Text Patcher Mod**: Carotene expands on Trainers' Legend G/Localify's text patching feature to give more freedom as well as to allow for custom style tags.

## Installation

Download the latest version of Carotene Patcher from [here](https://github.com/KevinVG207/Uma-Carotene-English-Patch/releases/latest/download/CarotenePatcher.exe). Run it from any location while your game is closed, click the Patch button and wait for it to finish. You can then start the game like normal. Click the Unpatch button to undo the patch (when the game is closed.) When the game itself has had an update, you must run the patcher again. It will tell you the game is only partially patched, so click Reapply.

## Contributing

At the moment, the patch mainly consists of general UI translations, character profiles, as well as some buttons during Training. Translation credits can be found in [this Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTGzdvDuab0gaSi6Yt8CBSchxDXCbrkSsxPESXCHCaU/edit?usp=sharing). I'm still working out how I would want a workflow with other contributors to work, including proper credit for your creative work, but for now here are the three repositories that make up the patch. If you want to contribute, be sure to let me know in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wvGHW65C6A), and contributions should be made via pull requests on GitHub.
